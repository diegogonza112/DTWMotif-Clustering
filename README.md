# DTWMotif-Clustering

This MatLab code was written for my research course, HMB 496Y1, at the University of Toronto - St. George (Sept 2022 - Apr 2023).

The majority of the code seen here was produced separately by Dr. Eamonn Keough and can be accessed here:

# Identifying Mood Motifs using High-Resolution Mood Symptom Time Series and Dynamic Time Warping

All of the code in k_driver.m was written by myself and used in conjunction with tweaks made throughout this repository to produce a motif clustering algorithm that leverages dynamic time warping to identify said motifs. The aforementioned tweaks were done by both myself and my research supervisor, Dr. David Kreindler.

If you would like to read more about the research project a pdf version of my final report for the course is available here:

# Disclaimer
It is important to note that the majority of this repository was made by Dr. Keough and I do not take credit for any of the work he did, however, k_driver.m is and extension of the work he did and is not very useful outside the context of his work, so I decided to include the entirety of the code that allows for k_driver.m to work as designed.

Moreover, I am happy to share my work with anyone that would like to use it for sandboxing purposes, however, if you plan to make a publication of any kind that leverages or is based on my work I would appreciate that you ask for my consent to do so using the email listed above.
